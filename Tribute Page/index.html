                Chester Charles Bennington Johnson, always called Chester Bennington, was an American singer,
                songwriter, and actor, known for being the vocalist of bands like Linkin Park and Dead by Sunrise. He
                was born on March 20, 1976, in Phoenix, Arizona, and was the son of Lee Russell Bennington and Susan
                Elaine Johnson.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chester Bennington became interested in music from an early age, having as inspiration Depeche Mode and
                Stone Temple Pilots. He always dreamed of becoming a member of the Stone Temple Pilots.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bennington was avictim of sexual abuse from an older male friend when he was seven years old. He was
                afraid to ask for help because he did not want people to think he was gay or lying, and the abuse
                continued until he was 13 years old. His parents separated when he was 9 years old, so he went into the
                custody of his father. The separation of his parents and the abuse affected him so much that he fell
                into the use of marijuana, alcohol, cocaine, and LSD. Fortunately, after a while, he managed to overcome
                those addictions.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1993, he joined as a vocalist the local rock band called Gray Daze, where he managed to get more
                musical recognition; However, he left the band in 1998 due to creative differences with the members of
                the
                group. Sometime later, Chester Bennington met Jeff Blue, vice president of Zomba Music; who told the
                young man
                about the auditions to be a member of the band, Linkin Park.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the year 1999, he moved to Los Angeles, to try to enter Xero (Name of the band at that time). At his
                audition, Chester quickly attracted the attention of the band for his vocal quality, so he was accepted
                as a vocalist.
            </p>
            <p>
                After his arrival to the band, this changed name to Hybrid Theory and later of the independent way the
                first work that realized was Hybrid Theory (EP), of which only one thousand copies were made. Later, the
                band
                changed its name to Lincoln Park, a name suggested by Chester, but due to an Internet domain that
                already had
                the name, they were renamed, Linkin Park.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1999, Chester Bennington and the band signed with the label Warner Bros. Records and in 2000 they
                released their first studio album entitled “Hybrid Theory” which until now is their most impactful
                album, since that time, Chester and the band published the recordings: Meteora (2003), Minutes to
                Midnight (2007), A Thousand Suns (2010), Living Things (2012), The Hunting Party (2014), and One More
                Light (2017) ), also worked on the Collision Course album with Jay-Z.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2002, they started their Projekt Revolution tour taking it to different stages in different years
                throughout his career.
            </p>
            <p>

                    While on vacation in Arizona with his wife and family, Bennington returned home alone, saying he
                    had
                    work to do.
                    Shortly before 9:00 a.m. PDT on July 20, 2017, Bennington was found dead by his housekeeper at
                    his
                    home
                    in Palos Verdes Estates, California. His death was ruled a suicide by hanging. Bennington left
                    no
                    suicide note Bandmate and close friend Mike Shinoda confirmed his death on Twitter, writing,
                    "Shocked
                    and heartbroken, but it's true.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An official statement will come out as soon as we have one." On July 21, Brian Elias, the chief
                    of
                    operations for the office of the medical examiner-coroner, confirmed that a half-empty bottle of
                    alcohol
                    was found at the scene, but no other drugs were present. A toxicology report released in
                    December
                    reported "a trace amount" of alcohol in Bennington's system at the time of death.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bennington's death occurred on what would have been Chris Cornell's 53rd birthday. Cornell's
                    death
                    was
                    also ruled as suicide by hanging two months earlier. After Bennington's death, Linkin Park
                    canceled
                    the
                    rest of their One More Light Tour and refunded tickets.
